# Adaliszk.io

This repository contains my whole website's codebase to share with you openly. The desire here is to showcase a website
architecture by utilising modern technologies with the minimal footprint possible.

### Prerequisites

- Node
- Yarn
- Turbo

### Feature-set:

- Statically Generated pages to serve from a CDN
- Event-Driven to trigger site generation or integration dynamically
- Backend actions and requests processed as functions
- Deployed and scaled automatically in Kubernetes

### Structure

- **/apps**: independent Qwik applications for each domain
- **/packages**: shared configurations and helpers
- **/services**: backend APIs and processors as services
